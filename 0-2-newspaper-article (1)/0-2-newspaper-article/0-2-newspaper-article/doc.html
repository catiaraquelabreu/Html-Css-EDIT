            <p>The hygge lifestyle can be for anyone and everyone — you just have to prioritize comfort. Your house
                should feel like a home, not cold and detached. When you extend your comfort to the outdoors, you build
                a space that offers several benefits and makes you feel right at home on your property.</p>
            <h3>What is Hygge?</h3>
            <p>Hygge, a Danish word pronounced “hyoo-gah,” is a lifestyle that embraces coziness and the calm of life.
                You want to feel comfortable in your own home, and following a 
            <a href="https://blog.smartfurniture.com/what-does-it-mean-to-live-a-hygge-lifestyle/">hygge
                    lifestyle</a> will let you relax — no more worrying about what other people may think about you or
                your home. You want your home to be welcoming and inviting, not necessarily look perfect on social
                media.

            <h3> Why Being Outdoors Is Great For You</h3>
            <p>Since you want to use every part of your home, you should ensure that your backyard is hospitable and
                makes you want to spend time outside. Being out in the sunlight can trigger physical growth and
                development, and it also plays a part in regulating your mental health. Spending time outside is
                directly linked to better physical and mental well-being. When you build a cozier outdoor space that
                becomes your hygge, you can enjoy every moment outside.
            </p>
            <h3>How to Level Up Your Backyard</h3>
            <p>ou don’t need the fanciest gadgets to have a backyard that invites people in. Just prioritize coziness
                and you’ll draw people to your home. Your backyard is part of your home, so you should strive to make it
                as comforting as every other area of your home.
            </p>
            <h4>Hang Up Warm Lights
            </h4>
            <p>Adding lighting to your outdoor areas can make them feel cozier than before. Instead of relying on one
                main light to illuminate your space, you can make your whole space feel homier with several softer
                lights. Using more energy-efficient, quality lighting can even lower your energy use by almost 70%. In
                addition to saving money on your energy bills, you’ll have a cozy backyard that welcomes family members
                and guests alike.
            </p>
            <h4>Soundproof Your Space</h4>
            <p>With a soundproofed backyard, you can spend time outside without worrying about too much noise leaking in
                or out. However, soundproofing your backyard is nothing like soundproofing a room. Instead of using
                artificial materials to act as a barrier, you can
                <a href="https://www.soundproofcow.com/soundproofing-tips-backyard/">lean into natural things</a>, like
                shrubs and hedges, to help absorb
                some of the noise.
